# CJ → PulseSoc: import to checkout, stage by stage

Every claim here was measured — by running the chain against a temp database, or
by querying production read-only — not read off a screen. Where a stage is
untested or unreachable it says so rather than guessing.

Date: 2026-09-10. Production has exactly one supplier-sourced listing (id 14,
the CJ upholstered bed, `CJFU2755187`), one variant, zero orders.

## The one-line summary

A supplier product is not a sellable listing. Between the two sit eleven stages,
two separate price representations, two separate media representations, and one
authority (moderation) that the merchant does not control. The pipeline was
broken at the seam where the merchant's world hands off to the buyer's.

## The seam that was broken

**The merchant and the buyer store price in different places, and nothing joined
them.**

- Merchant prices `marketplace_listing_variants.price_cents` (via
  `drafts._set_prices`, which deliberately writes that column and no other, so a
  price edit cannot blank supplier cost).
- Buyer is charged from `marketplace_listings.price_label`, parsed by
  `bot.parse_price_label_to_cents`, in `cart_routes._listing_price_minor`.
- `marketplace_variants` is imported by the supplier package **and by nothing
  else** — verified by grep. The buyer has no variant selector and no path to
  the merchant's number.

Measured before the fix, on the real chain (import → price every variant at
$20.00 → publish → approve):

```
price_label   : ''
is_public     : True          <- publicly discoverable
denial_code   : ''            <- nothing reported wrong
cart charges  : 0 minor units
add-to-cart   : REFUSED "This item is not priced for checkout."
```

Publicly listed, unbuyable, no signal to the merchant, and a message to the buyer
that blames the item. **Every dropship product ever published ended there.**

Fixed in `202c6b26`: `publish()` writes `price_label` from the variants. Measured
after: `cart charges 2000 minor units, add-to-cart accepted`.

Publishing can only write a price it could honestly honour, so three states the
gate used to wave through are now named:

| code | what it stops |
|---|---|
| `MISSING_PRICE` (tightened `all` → `any`) | a blank variant being sold at its neighbour's price |
| `VARIANT_PRICE_SPREAD` (new) | one listing-level price silently chosen from several |
| `PRICE_ABOVE_CHECKOUT_LIMIT` (new) | `parse_price_label_to_cents` **clamps** to `MAX_PRICE_LABEL_CENTS`; `_set_prices` accepts 10× that, so between the limits the card is charged $999,999.99 |

Repricing a *live* listing writes the label too — otherwise the draft screen
shows the new number while the cart keeps charging the old one.

## Blockers, by stage

**Publication blockers** (`drafts._validate`, all reported at once, never one at
a time): `MISSING_TITLE`, `MISSING_CATEGORY`, `NO_VALID_MEDIA`,
`NO_VARIANTS_SELECTED`, `MISSING_PRICE`, `VARIANT_PRICE_SPREAD`,
`PRICE_ABOVE_CHECKOUT_LIMIT`, `NEGATIVE_MARGIN`, `UNKNOWN_INVENTORY`,
`SUPPLIER_DISCONNECTED`, `PROVIDER_PRODUCT_UNAVAILABLE`, `RESTRICTED_PRODUCT`.

**Discovery blockers** (`lifecycle.public_denial_code`): `SELLER_UNAVAILABLE`
(includes a seller with no public store name), `ITEM_UNAVAILABLE`,
`OUT_OF_STOCK`.

**Checkout blockers** (`cart_routes`): own listing, cart full, `price_minor <= 0`,
goods policy, below Stripe's minimum charge, fulfillment lane unchosen.

**Fulfillment blockers** (`suppliers/fulfillment.create_intent`):
`connection_not_ready`, `shop_binding_required` (connect no longer requires
choosing a CJ shop; fulfillment does, because `_validate_observed` proves a
placed order came back on the shop we bound), sandbox assertion.

## Things that are correct and easy to break

- **Publish does not self-approve.** `is_public` needs status *and* approval;
  a publish path that set `approval_status` would be a merchant self-certifying
  past review.
- **Published quantity counts confirmed variants, not supplier stock.** The
  supplier's warehouse is not ours to oversell. A supplier outage lowers the
  number toward zero rather than inventing stock.
- **UNKNOWN ≠ out of stock.** All-unknown blocks publication; one confirmed
  variant is enough, the rest are simply not offered.
- **Unknown cost yields unknown price and unknown margin** — never zero, never
  100%. `suppliers/pricing.py` returns `None` throughout and names margin states
  rather than returning bare numbers.
- **Cost is merchant-private.** It reaches the draft screen and no buyer surface.

## Known gaps, not yet fixed

1. **`lifecycle.is_public` has no price condition.** A listing with an empty
   `price_label` is publicly discoverable and then refused at add-to-cart. The
   dropship path can no longer produce one (publish writes the label), but a
   manual seller blanking their price still can. **Production check: zero such
   listings today**, so this is latent, not active.
2. **No buyer-side variant selection.** A multi-variant product can only be sold
   at a single price; `VARIANT_PRICE_SPREAD` now refuses the alternative rather
   than guessing, but the real fix is a variant selector on the product page.
3. **Production listing 14 has `cover_image_url = NULL`** — imported before
   `2b9a36a2`. One-row backfill from `listing_metadata_json.media[0]` is
   available and has not been run.
4. **`vault.seal`/`unseal` wrap everything in `except Exception: raise
   VaultError() from None`**, which turns a caller's mistake into what looks
   like an infrastructure failure. Cost me a false alarm already.
5. **Fulfillment is unreachable for the current connection** —
   `external_shop_id` is unset, so `create_intent` raises
   `shop_binding_required`. This is an honest refusal, and §37 forbids placing a
   real CJ order regardless.
