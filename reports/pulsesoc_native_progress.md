# PulseSoc Native Migration Progress

Date: 2026-07-04

## Current Native State

The native app lives separately under `mobile-native/`. The current production WebView app remains untouched and continues to serve existing PulseSoc users.

Completed native foundations:

- App shell: Expo React Native, native stack/tab navigation, native deep-link configuration.
- Auth/session: login, signup, restore, logout through existing mobile auth APIs.
- API base URL/session safety: normalized API base URL, cookie-backed session reuse, network failure handling.
- Push registration: Expo push token registration through existing `/api/push/subscribe`.
- Mission Control: basic native connection to `/api/dashboard/mission-control`.
- Messenger: conversation list, conversation screen, text send, retry, receipts, typing, sync polling, offline cache, image/file/voice upload paths using existing Messenger APIs.
- Messenger hardening: corrupt-cache fallback, foreground/background sync recovery, upload-in-flight guard, long-thread list settings.
- Notifications: native notification center, unread/badge sync, mark read, mark all read, delete, preferences, push permission state, foreground badge refresh, background tap routing structure, and native/web target fallback.
- Home Feed + Post Detail: native feed list, pagination, pull-to-refresh, offline cache, post detail, comments, add comment, reactions, save, repost, share hook, image media cards, and `/pulse/post/<post_id>` deep-link routing through existing PulseSoc APIs.
- Pulse AI: basic chat through existing `/api/pulse/assistant/chat`.
- Profile: native current profile, public profile route, profile posts/media/about tabs, profile edit, avatar/cover upload/remove, profile theme selection, offline cache, and profile deep links through existing PulseSoc profile/feed/theme APIs.
- Reels Player + Reel Detail: native full-screen vertical Reels feed, Expo AV video playback, Mux/R2 media URL reuse, infinite scrolling, pull-to-refresh, metadata cache, comments, reactions, save, repost, share, follow creator, not interested, report, view tracking, profile navigation, and `/pulse/reels/<reel_id>` deep-link routing through existing Reels APIs.
- Status Viewer + Status Detail: native Status rail, Status list, full-screen viewer, image/video/text rendering, tap navigation, view tracking, reactions, replies, shares, music display, offline metadata cache, and `/pulse/status/<status_id>` deep-link routing through existing Status APIs.
- Media Capture + Upload Foundation: shared native image picker, video picker, camera entry point, permission states, file validation, upload progress, retry, cancellation, processing-status polling, reusable upload hook/service, and reusable media preview component over existing PulseSoc media APIs.
- Feed Composer Foundation: native composer entry from Home Feed, text/title publishing, visibility selector, image/video/camera attachment through the shared media upload layer, upload preview/progress/retry/cancel, publish states, and feed refresh through existing PulseSoc post APIs.
- Status Creator Foundation: native Status composer entry, text/image/video Status publishing, camera/gallery integration, shared upload preview/progress/retry/cancel, privacy/duration selectors, music search/trending hooks, AI Story generation hook, and Status rail refresh through existing PulseSoc Status APIs.
- Media Viewer Foundation: shared full-screen native image/video viewer, pinch-to-zoom image structure, swipe-down close, previous/next navigation, processing-status checks, share/save/profile hooks, metadata display, and integrations for Feed/Post/Profile, Messenger attachments, and Status media hooks.
- Marketplace Browse + Listing Detail Foundation: native Marketplace tab, search/browse through existing marketplace API, listing cards, listing detail modal, media gallery through NativeMediaViewer, save/report/contact seller hooks, safe checkout routing, offline cache, and marketplace deep-link routing.
- Search + Discovery Foundation: native Search tab/route, debounced global search through existing `/api/pulse/search`, recent and suggested searches, discovery tabs, grouped result cards, pull-to-refresh, cached result fallback, native destination routing, `/pulse/search` deep-link routing, and web fallback for unsupported result URLs.
- Saved Content + Collections Foundation: native Saved tab/route, saved item list, type filters, collection filters, create/rename/delete collection actions, remove/move saved item actions, saved search, offline cache, item deep-link routing, and `/pulse/saved` deep-link routing through existing saved APIs.
- Groups/Communities + Rooms Foundation: native Groups tab/detail route, thin read-only group JSON bridge, communities browse/search, room rail, group detail, rules/member metadata, compact group feed preview, join/leave, report, group chat open, room open, offline cache, and group/room deep-link routing through existing group, room, and Messenger APIs.
- Architecture Health Report + Shared Core Consolidation: native architecture audit, shared cache helper under `mobile-native/src/core/cache.ts`, first refactor of Groups/Saved/Marketplace cache wrappers, duplicate-pattern inventory, production WebView safety check, and next Live Discovery recommendation.

- native QA browser/device validation status, feature parity gaps, release blockers, and WebView replacement readiness

## Recommended Next Feature

Recommendation: create Native Feature Parity + QA Readiness Report next.

This should come before another major native module.

## Why This Comes Next

- The native app now covers most major PulseSoc pillars, including Feed, Messenger, Notifications, Profile, Reels, Status, Marketplace, Search, Saved, Groups, Live viewer, Premium, Creator Studio, Growth, and Intelligence.
- The user has shifted the migration into QA-driven development.
- Continuing to add feature modules without browser/device QA increases integration risk.
- A parity report can compare current WebView PulseSoc against native coverage and produce an evidence-based hardening order.
- This recommendation is based on the current production and `mobile-native` migration state after the Intelligence + Alerts checkpoint.

## Reusable Existing PulseSoc Logic

Reuse directly:

- Existing native progress reports and audit scripts.
- Existing production route inventory in `bot.py`.
- Existing native screens, API wrappers, cache helpers, notification routing, deep-link routing, and fallback patterns.
- Existing production feature inventory reports where available.
- Existing backend route/database/service ownership for Feed, Messenger, Notifications, Profile, Reels, Status, Marketplace, Search, Saved, Groups, Live, Premium, Creator, Growth, Intelligence, Calls, Camera, and Settings.

Do not duplicate in native:

- Backend business logic.
- WebView behavior assumptions.
- Device/browser QA claims that were not actually tested.
- Production route behavior.

## What Must Be Rebuilt Natively

- A native-vs-WebView feature parity report.
- A QA readiness matrix.
- A missing-feature and fallback inventory.
- A browser/device verification status table.
- A release-blocker list before replacing any WebView surfaces.
- A hardening order for the next native QA passes.
- An audit script that verifies the report exists and covers the major PulseSoc pillars.

## Dependencies And Blockers

Dependencies:

- Current native reports and audit scripts must be present.
- Production route inventory must be inspected again.
- `mobile-native` navigation, screens, API wrappers, and fallback surfaces must be inspected again.

Blockers:

- Real iOS/Android device behavior cannot be marked verified without simulator/device access.
- QA browser validation depends on launching the Expo app or a supported local target.
- Some PulseSoc features still intentionally use web fallback and should not be counted as native-complete.

## Risk Level

Risk: Low.

Reasons:

- This is a reporting/audit checkpoint.
- Risk comes from inaccurate inventory, not production behavior.
- No WebView production routes should be changed.

## Estimated Complexity

Complexity: Medium.

Recommended first slice:

- Inspect production PulseSoc feature surfaces.
- Inspect `mobile-native` screens, API wrappers, routes, reports, and audits.
- Build a feature parity matrix.
- Add QA-driven development checklist and per-feature QA status.
- Identify highest-risk remaining gaps and hardening order.
- Add static audit for report completeness.

Defer from first slice:

- New user-facing feature work.
- Native LiveKit hosting/calls.
- Camera/editor expansion.
- Any App Store replacement recommendation.

## Safest Implementation Plan

1. Inspect production PulseSoc routes, services, and existing platform inventory.
2. Inspect `mobile-native` screens, API wrappers, navigation, cache helpers, reports, and audit scripts.
3. Build a parity matrix across major PulseSoc pillars.
4. Mark each feature as native-ready, partial native, web fallback, missing, or device-QA required.
5. Identify highest-risk regressions before replacing WebView surfaces.
6. Add a QA-driven development checklist and hardening order.
7. Add report and audit script.
8. Run the standard verification suite.

## Recommendation Summary

Create Native Feature Parity + QA Readiness Report next. The native app has enough breadth that the highest-value work is now an evidence-based parity and QA checkpoint before more major feature expansion.
