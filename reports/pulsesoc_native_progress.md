# PulseSoc Native Migration Progress

Date: 2026-07-04

## Current Native State

The native app lives separately under `mobile-native/`. The current production WebView app remains untouched and continues to serve existing PulseSoc users.

Completed native foundations:

- App shell: Expo React Native, native stack/tab navigation, native deep-link configuration.
- Auth/session: login, signup, restore, logout through existing mobile auth APIs.
- API base URL/session safety: normalized API base URL, cookie-backed session reuse, network failure handling.
- Push registration: Expo push token registration through existing `/api/push/subscribe`.
- Mission Control: basic native connection to `/api/dashboard/mission-control`.
- Messenger: conversation list, conversation screen, text send, retry, receipts, typing, sync polling, offline cache, image/file/voice upload paths using existing Messenger APIs.
- Messenger hardening: corrupt-cache fallback, foreground/background sync recovery, upload-in-flight guard, long-thread list settings.
- Notifications: native notification center, unread/badge sync, mark read, mark all read, delete, preferences, push permission state, foreground badge refresh, background tap routing structure, and native/web target fallback.
- Home Feed + Post Detail: native feed list, pagination, pull-to-refresh, offline cache, post detail, comments, add comment, reactions, save, repost, share hook, image media cards, and `/pulse/post/<post_id>` deep-link routing through existing PulseSoc APIs.
- Pulse AI: basic chat through existing `/api/pulse/assistant/chat`.
- Profile: native current profile, public profile route, profile posts/media/about tabs, profile edit, avatar/cover upload/remove, profile theme selection, offline cache, and profile deep links through existing PulseSoc profile/feed/theme APIs.
- Reels Player + Reel Detail: native full-screen vertical Reels feed, Expo AV video playback, Mux/R2 media URL reuse, infinite scrolling, pull-to-refresh, metadata cache, comments, reactions, save, repost, share, follow creator, not interested, report, view tracking, profile navigation, and `/pulse/reels/<reel_id>` deep-link routing through existing Reels APIs.
- Status Viewer + Status Detail: native Status rail, Status list, full-screen viewer, image/video/text rendering, tap navigation, view tracking, reactions, replies, shares, music display, offline metadata cache, and `/pulse/status/<status_id>` deep-link routing through existing Status APIs.
- Media Capture + Upload Foundation: shared native image picker, video picker, camera entry point, permission states, file validation, upload progress, retry, cancellation, processing-status polling, reusable upload hook/service, and reusable media preview component over existing PulseSoc media APIs.
- Feed Composer Foundation: native composer entry from Home Feed, text/title publishing, visibility selector, image/video/camera attachment through the shared media upload layer, upload preview/progress/retry/cancel, publish states, and feed refresh through existing PulseSoc post APIs.
- Status Creator Foundation: native Status composer entry, text/image/video Status publishing, camera/gallery integration, shared upload preview/progress/retry/cancel, privacy/duration selectors, music search/trending hooks, AI Story generation hook, and Status rail refresh through existing PulseSoc Status APIs.
- Media Viewer Foundation: shared full-screen native image/video viewer, pinch-to-zoom image structure, swipe-down close, previous/next navigation, processing-status checks, share/save/profile hooks, metadata display, and integrations for Feed/Post/Profile, Messenger attachments, and Status media hooks.
- Marketplace Browse + Listing Detail Foundation: native Marketplace tab, search/browse through existing marketplace API, listing cards, listing detail modal, media gallery through NativeMediaViewer, save/report/contact seller hooks, safe checkout routing, offline cache, and marketplace deep-link routing.
- Search + Discovery Foundation: native Search tab/route, debounced global search through existing `/api/pulse/search`, recent and suggested searches, discovery tabs, grouped result cards, pull-to-refresh, cached result fallback, native destination routing, `/pulse/search` deep-link routing, and web fallback for unsupported result URLs.
- Saved Content + Collections Foundation: native Saved tab/route, saved item list, type filters, collection filters, create/rename/delete collection actions, remove/move saved item actions, saved search, offline cache, item deep-link routing, and `/pulse/saved` deep-link routing through existing saved APIs.
- Groups/Communities + Rooms Foundation: native Groups tab/detail route, thin read-only group JSON bridge, communities browse/search, room rail, group detail, rules/member metadata, compact group feed preview, join/leave, report, group chat open, room open, offline cache, and group/room deep-link routing through existing group, room, and Messenger APIs.
- Architecture Health Report + Shared Core Consolidation: native architecture audit, shared cache helper under `mobile-native/src/core/cache.ts`, first refactor of Groups/Saved/Marketplace cache wrappers, duplicate-pattern inventory, production WebView safety check, and next Live Discovery recommendation.
- Live Discovery + Live Viewer Foundation: native Live tab/detail route, Live Now discovery through existing `/api/pulse/live-now`, native viewer shell using existing playback manifest URLs, join viewer state, chat read/send, reactions, viewer count/state refresh, offline cache, deep-link routing for Live links, and safe web fallback for Go Live/Studio/hosting/co-hosting/unsupported playback.
- Live Viewer Device QA + Hardening: documented unavailable simulator/device tooling, added AppState foreground recovery for Live state/chat/list refresh, added playback failure fallback state, guarded host/profile navigation from empty profile keys, preserved safe web fallback for Studio/hosting/co-hosting/calls, and kept device-only playback claims unverified.
- Premium + Entitlements Foundation: native Premium route, server-authoritative status display through `/api/premium/status`, Founder/Premium badge display, entitlement list, cached fallback, app-resume refresh, existing checkout/billing portal provider handoff, Settings/Profile entry points, `/pulse/premium` deep-link routing, and explicit no-local-entitlement boundary.
- Settings: session controls, push registration, notification preferences entry.

- Creator logic: `services/dashboard_creator_command_center.py`, creator cards/subsystems, owner-scoped creator metrics, content/moderation/processing summaries, creator event-bus recommendations, and creator AI hook routing.
- Current native reuse surface: repeated API wrappers, shared cache functions, screen-level loading/empty/error/offline states, native/web fallback routing, card layouts, action busy states, media preview/viewer hooks, tab/stack route patterns, Premium status/handoff patterns, and routing across Feed, Messenger, Notifications, Profile, Reels, Status, Marketplace, Search, Saved, Groups, Live, and Premium.

Existing data/business logic that should remain server-authoritative:

- `pulse_posts`
- `pulse_comments`
- `pulse_reactions`
- `pulse_post_saves`
- `pulse_saved_items`
- `pulse_media_assets`
- `chat_media_uploads`
- `users`
- feed ranking and visibility rules
- moderation/risk status
- premium identity rendering data
- notification fanout
- mention notifications
- media storage/Mux processing
- saved-content collections
- follow graph
- marketplace listing moderation/safety
- seller trust/readiness
- marketplace save/report behavior
- marketplace order/payment/payout rules
- PulseSoc search ranking/grouping/result routing
- saved item collection ownership and removal
- group membership, roles, moderation, invite links, group chats, and group post/comment rules
- shared native routing, caching, error, card, and media-viewer behavior that should be consolidated before deeper Live/Calls/Premium work
- LiveKit/Mux session authority, live room state, live chat, replay creation, feed insertion, destination handling, and creator/host permissions
- premium subscription status, founder membership, entitlement grants/revocation, profile themes, premium badges, billing portal eligibility, and Stripe checkout state
- creator dashboard state, creator metrics, moderation/review counts, media processing state, creator AI provider routing, creator recommendations, and creator monetization/payout decisions

## Recommended Next Feature

Recommendation: build Native Creator Studio Foundation next.

This should come before Growth Center, native Go Live, native LiveKit hosting, native calls, and advanced creator monetization.

## Why This Comes Next

- Premium/Entitlements is now available natively, so creator capabilities can show active/locked/unavailable state without duplicating entitlement logic.
- The backend already exposes owner-scoped Creator Studio state through `GET /api/dashboard/creator/state`.
- Existing native Feed Composer, Status Creator, Reels, Media Upload, Media Viewer, Live viewer, Marketplace, Profile, Search, and Premium screens are the exact building blocks Creator Studio needs.
- Creator Studio is higher leverage than Growth Center because it organizes creation workflows already built natively and can keep Go Live/hosting on safe web fallback.
- This recommendation is based on the current creator backend and native migration state after the Premium foundation checkpoint.

## Reusable Existing PulseSoc Logic

Reuse directly:

- Existing `GET /api/dashboard/creator/state`.
- Existing `/pulse/creator/dashboard` and `/pulse/creator-studio` route behavior.
- Existing `POST /api/pulse/creator-ai/<tool>`.
- Existing `services/dashboard_creator_command_center.py` creator metrics, subsystem cards, recommendations, and event-bus summaries.
- Existing post, Reel, video, Status, Live, moderation, media processing, and creator score database reads.
- Existing Premium status/entitlement display for locked/active creator capability state.
- Existing native Feed Composer, Status Creator, Reels, Media Upload, Media Viewer, Live viewer, Profile, Marketplace, Search, routing, cache, and loading/error patterns.

Do not duplicate in native:

- Backend business logic.
- Creator score calculations.
- Creator metric aggregation.
- Moderation/review decisions.
- Processing state decisions.
- Creator AI provider routing or prompt policy.
- Premium/creator entitlement checks.
- Creator monetization, payout, payment, refund, webhook, and provider business logic.

## What Must Be Rebuilt Natively

- Native Creator Studio dashboard screen.
- Creator metric and recommendation cards.
- Creator content shortcuts into existing native creation/playback surfaces.
- Creator AI tool form using existing backend hooks.
- Premium/locked capability display using native Premium status.
- Processing, moderation, empty, offline, loading, and error states.
- Deep-link routing for `/pulse/creator/dashboard` and `/pulse/creator-studio`.
- Web fallback for unsupported Studio tools, payouts, monetization, and native Live hosting.

## Dependencies And Blockers

Dependencies:

- Confirm `GET /api/dashboard/creator/state` payload shape.
- Confirm creator AI hook response shape for `hook`, `caption`, `virality`, and `live-title`.
- Reuse existing Premium state for capability gating.
- Reuse existing native upload, media viewer, composer, routing, cache, and error components.

Blockers:

- Native Live hosting remains deferred.
- Creator monetization, payouts, paid courses, and in-app purchases require separate payment-policy planning.
- Some Studio web tools may need web fallback until native equivalents exist.
- Creator AI requires backend availability and should degrade safely if provider routing is unavailable.

## Risk Level

Risk: Medium.

Reasons:

- Creator Studio touches many product surfaces, but backend risk stays medium if native only reads owner-scoped creator state and calls existing creator AI hooks.
- UX risk is moderate because this becomes a central workflow surface.
- Payment, payout, entitlement, and Live hosting risk stays contained if those flows remain web/provider fallback in the first slice.

## Estimated Complexity

Complexity: Medium-high.

Recommended first slice:

- Inspect creator state and creator AI payloads.
- Build read-only Creator Studio dashboard first.
- Add native navigation shortcuts into existing creator-related native screens.
- Add creator AI form with safe error states.
- Add Premium-aware locked/active capability cards.
- Add static audit that verifies no native creator ranking, monetization, payout, or entitlement logic is duplicated.

Defer from first slice:

- Native Live hosting.
- Creator payouts and monetization writes.
- Scheduling writes if the backend contract is not clear.
- Local creator score calculations.
- In-app purchase or native payment work.

## Safest Implementation Plan

1. Inspect `GET /api/dashboard/creator/state`, `/pulse/creator/dashboard`, `/pulse/creator-studio`, and `POST /api/pulse/creator-ai/<tool>`.
2. Add a native creator API wrapper that reads existing creator state and calls creator AI hooks only.
3. Build native Creator Studio dashboard cards from server-owned metrics and recommendations.
4. Reuse existing native navigation into Feed Composer, Reels, Status Creator, Media Upload, Marketplace, Live viewer, Premium, and Profile.
5. Add web fallback for unsupported Creator Studio tools, payouts, monetization, scheduling, and Live hosting.
6. Add progress report and audit script.
7. Run the standard native verification suite.
8. Keep creator metrics, moderation, monetization, payouts, entitlements, and AI provider behavior server-authoritative.

## Recommendation Summary

Build Native Creator Studio Foundation next. The backend already owns owner-scoped creator state, creator metrics, moderation/processing summaries, creator AI hooks, premium entitlement checks, and creator routes, and the native app now has enough reusable creation/media/profile/premium infrastructure to make Creator Studio a high-leverage native orchestration layer without touching Live hosting or payment logic.
